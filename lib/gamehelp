Basic Instructions:

You are a thief in ancient Athens, hired to burgle the coveted treasure of Eumisthyon, a newly rich merchant with many enemies. Your job is to make your way through the rooms of Eumisthyon's house and find your way to the prize - without getting caught.

Keep an eye on your visibility meter: a visibility of 100 means you are as good as dead.

You will have to become more visible at some points to proceed, so plan your moves carefully - the meter can rise very quickly.
